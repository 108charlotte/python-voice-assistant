# python-voice-assistant

Python voice assistant (aspiring JARVIS) is a web-based application built on flask which takes audio input from the browser, transcribes it, uses hack club ai to respond, and then converts that response to speech and speaks it back to you using an audio element in html. In the future, I hope to add more customized/personalized input to give it more personality!
